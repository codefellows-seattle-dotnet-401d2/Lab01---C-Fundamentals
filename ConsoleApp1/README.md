Welcome to my guessing game about me! Playing along with this 5 question quiz will help you get to know me a little better.
You will be prompted with the first question at start up along with a greeting. To answer these yes and no questions, simply enter y for yes, and n for no.
After you submit your answer, you will be told if your guess was correct or incorrect, and the next question will appear.
After you complete all 5 questions, your total right answers will be tallied and displayed, so you can see how many you got right. 
To exit the program, simply press enter once more.
Thanks for playing!
