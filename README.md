- **Readme.md required for submission. Missing readme document will result in a best score of 2/10**



##Matt Iwicki's README response
1) This project was a good way to get acquainted with the github extension on Visual Studio, as the process of cloning, changing, committing and pushing was prevalent in this lab.  Therefore, I needed that extension to be installed in order to complete this lab.  
2) The step by step directions for the user are simple; navigate through the questions, giving your answers, and find out your score at the end.  Once you are finished, the program will terminate.  My step by step process as the developer was much more complicated, as it took a lot of refactoring at the end in order to include more external methods.  Plus, with the complicated logic I was using before, I could not get the program to actually run.  
3) Once you press the "run program" button, you continue running the program by answering the questions as a user.  Once finished, you need to press enter to edn to program.  
4) The questions displayed properly, took correct and incorrect answers properly, and returned the correct score at the end for the user, so I know the program works properly.
